## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- BEM
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My previous project I've got a detailed critique from my fellow coder in frontend mentor then I was motivated of his words now I learned how to write dry code as you can see on how I write my script in sass. This will be my first step to write code cleanly as I could.

### Continued development

In my incoming projects I hope my javascript skill will improve with the help of my self. My eagerness to learn programming are incomparable.
